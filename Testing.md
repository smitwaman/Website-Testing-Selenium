Here's a hierarchical list of various types of testing commonly performed in website testing:

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or modules of the website.
   - **Integration Testing**: Testing the integration and interaction between different components/modules.
   - **System Testing**: Testing the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
   - **Regression Testing**: Testing to ensure that new changes or updates do not adversely affect existing functionality.

2. **Non-Functional Testing**:
   - **Performance Testing**: Testing the performance aspects of the website, such as speed, scalability, and stability.
   - **Load Testing**: Testing the website's ability to handle a specific load or number of concurrent users.
   - **Stress Testing**: Testing the website's ability to handle extreme conditions, such as high traffic or resource limitations.
   - **Usability Testing**: Testing the website's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.
   - **Accessibility Testing**: Testing the website's accessibility for users with disabilities, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
   - **Compatibility Testing**: Testing the website's compatibility with different browsers, devices, and operating systems.

3. **Security Testing**:
   - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying and assessing potential vulnerabilities in the website.
   - **Penetration Testing**: Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to assess the website's security posture.
   - **Authentication Testing**: Testing the website's authentication mechanisms, such as login and session management.
   - **Authorization Testing**: Testing the website's authorization mechanisms to ensure users have appropriate access rights.

4. **Database Testing**:
   - **Data Integrity Testing**: Testing the accuracy and consistency of data stored in the website's database.
   - **Data Migration Testing**: Testing the migration of data between different databases or systems.
   - **Data Validation Testing**: Testing the validation of user input and data submitted through forms or APIs.

5. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
   - **Alpha Testing**: Testing performed by the internal team before releasing the website to external users.
   - **Beta Testing**: Testing performed by a select group of external users before the website is released to the general public.
   - **Acceptance Testing**: Testing performed by end-users to ensure that the website meets their requirements and expectations.

6. **Automation Testing**:
   - **Functional Automation Testing**: Automating repetitive functional tests to improve efficiency and reliability.
   - **Regression Automation Testing**: Automating regression tests to ensure that new changes do not introduce defects.

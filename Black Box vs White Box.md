Black box testing and white box testing are two common approaches to software testing, each with its own methodology and focus. Let's explore them with examples:

### Black Box Testing:
- **Definition**: Black box testing, also known as behavioral testing or functional testing, is a software testing technique where the internal structure, implementation details, and code logic of the software are not known to the tester. Instead, the tester focuses on testing the functionality and behavior of the software based on its specifications, requirements, and inputs and outputs.
- **Methodology**: Testers treat the software as a black box, interacting with it solely through its external interfaces (e.g., GUI, API), without knowledge of its internal workings.
- **Examples**:
  1. **Web Application Testing**: Testing a web application by entering input data into web forms and verifying the output displayed on the web pages without considering how the application processes the data internally.
  2. **Calculator Testing**: Testing a calculator application by performing arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) and verifying the correctness of the results without knowing the algorithm used for computation.
- **Advantages**:
   - Tests are based on specifications and requirements, ensuring alignment with user expectations.
   - Testers do not require knowledge of the underlying code, making it suitable for black-box testing by non-developers.
- **Disadvantages**:
   - Limited coverage of internal code paths and logic.
   - Difficulty in identifying certain types of defects, such as boundary conditions or code-level issues.

### White Box Testing:
- **Definition**: White box testing, also known as structural testing or glass box testing, is a software testing technique where the tester has knowledge of the internal structure, implementation details, and code logic of the software being tested. Test cases are designed based on an understanding of the internal code paths, branches, and algorithms.
- **Methodology**: Testers examine the internal code structure, design test cases to exercise specific code paths, and verify the correctness of the software's behavior based on the internal logic.
- **Examples**:
  1. **Code Coverage Testing**: Ensuring that all code paths (e.g., branches, loops) in a program have been executed and tested at least once.
  2. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual units or components of a software application (e.g., functions, methods, classes) by writing test cases that exercise different code paths and functionalities.
- **Advantages**:
   - Comprehensive testing of internal code paths, leading to better coverage and defect detection.
   - Facilitates early detection of code-level issues and defects.
- **Disadvantages**:
   - Requires in-depth knowledge of the codebase and programming languages.
   - Test cases are tightly coupled with the implementation, making them more susceptible to changes in the code.

black box testing focuses on testing software based on its external behavior and specifications, while white box testing focuses on testing software based on its internal code structure and logic. Both approaches are valuable and complementary, and a combination of both is often used to achieve comprehensive test coverage.
